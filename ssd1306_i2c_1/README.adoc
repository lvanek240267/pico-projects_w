Analog-Digital clock driven by NTP based on:

    Raspberry PI Pico W
    SSD1306 128x64 OLED display
    24x RGB LED NeoPixel circle Ø65, WS2812B
    24x RGB LED NeoPixel circle Ø85, WS2812B
    Optional microSD slot for storing WiFi config

* For SSD1306 OLED display I use GP6 as SDA and GP7 as SCL. It's second I2C channel
* NeoPixels uses GP14 and GP15
* MicroSD card uses SPI1:
** MISO = GP8
** MOSI = GP11
** SCK = GP10
** CS (Chip Select) = GP9
* There is switch to enable DST. One side is connected to GND via 10k pull-down resistor and GP12, other side is connected to 3.3V
